# Front End Project

The idea for this project is to create a website for a 1960's pop band using only front-end technologies such as CSS and HTML, but excluding JavaScript. The project is intended to be as user-centric focused as possible.

This is the first project as part of my [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) online diploma course.

## User Experience Design

### User Stories

These are potential actions that users of the website would want to perform. They have to be taken into account when building the website.

* As a fan, I want to hear music clips from band 
* As a fan I want to be updated on new music the band releases
* As a fan I want to buy some of the band's music/see what they have
* As a client I want to see if this band is any good/hear from others
* As a client I want to book band for a gig
* As a client I want to contact the band 
* As a fan I want to know more about the band
* As a fan I want to see pictures of the band
* As a fan I want to watch a video of the band
* As a fan I want want to visit the band's social media

### Wireframes

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
