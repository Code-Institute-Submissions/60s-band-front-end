                <p class="about-text">The Monkees are an American rock and pop band originally active between 1966 and 1971, with reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed. They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider specifically
                    for the American television series The Monkees, which aired from 1966 to 1968. The musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork; and the English actor and singer Davy Jones. The band's
                    music was initially supervised by producer Don Kirshner, backed by the songwriting duo of Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart. </p>

                            was cast in the television sitcom The Monkees and became the drummer and a lead vocalist in the band created for the show. He was not actually a drummer and needed lessons even to be able to mime credibly, but eventually was
                            taught how to play properly. By the time The Monkees went on tour in late 1966, Dolenz was competent enough to play the drums himself.[5] He learned to play right-handed and left-footed because of a leg disease called Perthes
                            making his right leg weak. </p>

                            musician, and though other members of the group were not allowed to play their own instruments on their first two albums, he was an exception, playing what he described as "third chair guitar" on Michael Nesmith's song "Papa
                            Gene's Blues" on their first album. He subsequently played keyboards, bass guitar, banjo, harpsichord, and other instruments on their recordings. He co-wrote, along with Joey Richards, the closing theme song of the second season
                            of The Monkees, "For Pete's Sake". On the television show, he was relegated to playing the "lovable dummy", a persona Tork had developed as a folk singer in New York's Greenwich Village.[12]</p>
